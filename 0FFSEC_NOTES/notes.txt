# AI 
Gives human tasks such as natural language, recognizing objects and decision making and learning from experience to computers. 

- NLP
	- Computers understanding, interpreting and generating human language
	
- Computer Vision
	- Computer interpretation of images and videos.
	
- Robotics
	- Robots that can perform takes autonomously without needed human guidance most of the time. 
	
- Expert Systems
	- Creating systems that mimic decision-making of human experts.

# Machine Learning
Subset of AI that focuses on allowing systems to learn from data and improve tasks without explicit programming.

The system can make predictions, decisions or classifications based on evolving input data. 

- Supervised Learning
	- The algorithm learns from labeled data such as image classification, spam detection and fraud prevention.

- Unsupervised Learning
	- Learns from unlabled data like customer segmentation, anomalies and dimensionality reduction.

- Reinforcement Learning
	- Learn through trial and error by interacting with an environment and recieving feedback as a rewards or penalties like game scoreboards, robotics, autonomous driving.

# Deep Learning 
Subset of machine learning that uses neural networks to learn and extract features from complex data. Neural networks can detect complex patterns and representation within large datasets which makes it perfect for tasks involving images, audio and text. 

- Hiearchical Feature Learning
- End-to-end Learning 
- Scalability 

# Neural Networks Used
- Convolutional Neural Networks
	- For image and video data mainly.
- Recurrent Neural Networks
	- For sequential data like text and speech. Loops are available that allow information to persist across time steps.
- Transformers
	- Effective for natural language processing. Can handle long-range dependencies.
